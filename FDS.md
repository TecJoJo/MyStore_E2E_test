# Inspiration
Explore/validate utils + custom commands + selectors folder structure
  - Custom commands need no imports which is very swift
  - Problem is that how to organize nicely the custom commands as they scale, chances are, there will be hunders of them if not thousands. 
# More 
- tests should be included inside the folder, util/helper folder can be included under same folder where we put only test exclusive util funcitons
